		<h2>About My Birthdays</h2>
		<p>I was born in Buffalo NewYork, I lived there for six weeks then we moved to either Hinsville or Savannah.I can't really remember a lot of my birthdays but there are some special ones.
		one of my favorite Birthdays was when me and my older brother had a birthday together that was so cool. Even though his birthday is in May my Mother decided to have our birthdays together.
		It was really neat we had bouncy houses and different acitivty stations and tons of food. Around this time i think i was 5 or 7 i can't remember the age it was so many years ago in hinsville.
		Another one of my favorite birthdays is when i was 5, yes i remember now i was 5 years old and i had my birthday party at Chuckie-Cheese and after that my auntie took me to target
		and that was when i got my first Transformer. Till this day i love Transformers and i always will, after that we went home and i had more gifts awaiting. Now i'm going to say one more of my
		favorites even though i have a lot now that i can rememeber a lot of them i believe i was turning 17 and i was upstairs on my phone i just had got off from work from the Masters and my mom was saying
		my name like i was in trouble like i did something wrong and i was kind of aggravated and so i came downstair and i had a mean look on my face LOL. I walked into the kitchen and saw a bunch of ballons 
		but i noticed money in them but before that everyone was singing and saying how much i meant to them and i started crying and hugged my mother and popped the balloons and got $117 so cool.</p>
		
		<p>Now as far as gifts i loved getting money and toys and technology even at this age i still play with them from time to time because i had a very awesome childhood. I love any and everything i get for my birthday
		even if it isn't much. for my 19th birthday my mom got me a tv because i never had my own and i love gaming.</p>
