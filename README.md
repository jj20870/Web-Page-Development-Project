Hello all in order to see my actual webiste you need to have the latest version of notepad++ installed.
After you have the lastes version of notepad++ installed you want to download the zip file that holds all of my code 
Next you want to extract that file 
lastly as soon as you open either of the htmls in notepad++ go back to the folder you just extracted with the code and click on either of the html sites 
You now can see my website.
