Hello all in order to see my actual webiste you need to have the latest version of notepad++ installed.
After you have the latest version of notepad++ installed you want to download the zip file that holds all of my code from this github repository.  
Next you want to extract that file. 
The file you just extracted has created a separate folder. You now want to open one of those html files in notepadd++. 
lastly as soon as you open either of the html files in notepad++ go back to the folder you just extracted with the code and click on either of the html sites. 
You now can see my website. 
The cool thing about my website is that everything is functional. So if you click any of the links it will take to you that website or wikipedia.
